# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

A DAO, or “Decentralized Autonomous Organization,” is a community-led entity with no central authority. It is fully autonomous and transparent: smart contracts lay the foundational rules, execute the agreed upon decisions, and at any point, proposals, voting, and even the very code itself can be publicly audited.

- **Decentralized** = Online, global, uncensorable.
- **Autonomous** = Self-governing.
- **Organization** = Coordination & collaboration around shared objectives.

## The great history of DAOs

- [DAO in 2013] In late 2013, the concept emerged due to an [article](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/) by V. Buterin, in which he suggested the term Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) to describe the ‘holy grail’ of organization types

- [DAO in 2016] Inspired by the decentralization of cryptocurrencies, a group of developers came up with the idea for a first DAO, called The DAO, in 2016. Before its launch, The DAO had an initial creation period during which people could send Ether to a unique wallet address in exchange for DAO tokens on a 1-100 scale. The DAO ended up raising 12.7M Ether ($150M at the time, or $44.4B in today’s valuation). However, the experiment proved short-lived when The DAO was hacked one month after its launch.Read the [story of The Dao](https://medium.com/swlh/the-story-of-the-dao-its-history-and-consequences-71e6a8a551ee) here.

- [DAO in 2019] Emergence of a ton of new and different DAO projects, focusing mainly on tooling and governance. [Aragon](https://aragon.org/dao) allows anyone to create and manage an organization with no code, [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/) is the issuer of DAI stablecoin and mananges its governance through MKR token, [MolochDAO](https://molochdao.com) who introduced ERC-20 as the technical standard for DAO smart contracts and led to a bunch of [forks] (https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch)

## Current State of DAOs

DAOs treasuries now hold more than [$11B of Asset under management](https://deepdao.io/organizations) with arounf than 1.7B members.

DAO have spread and specialized to different use cases. Some important projects (not exhaustive at ALL):

**DAO Tooling**
- [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io): Multi signature wallet
- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/): Decentralized voting system. Creating proposals and voting on Snapshot is user-friendly and does not cost gas as the process is performed off-chain. Used by Uniswap, Aave, Sushi, OlympusDao, Curve, Yearn ...


**Investment DAOs**
- [Syndicate](https://syndicate.io): Launched in 2021. "Tranform a wallet into a powerful web3 investment club". Their first feature called Investment club has been skyrocketing and allows to invest in both on-chain and off-chain assets.
*[TIPS] Have a look at their [Solidity Hiring test](https://github.com/SyndicateProtocol/Bank-Solidity-Hiring)*
- [Meta Cartel](https://www.metacartel.org): Launched in late 2018. Non-profit grants fund focused on creation and impact funded mostly by individuals in the community. They fund various projects ranging from cryptonative experiments to DApps built on Ethereum.

**Open Sourcce DAO smart contracts**
- [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz): Build your DAO, and vote seamlessly on hundreds of DAOs. A lot of tutorials on governance and cross chain abilities (https://github.com/withtally)
- [PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app): Create a party to buy an NFT and reeive fractional ownership. Smart contracts can be reused for any investment purpose DAO (https://github.com/PartyDAO/partybid)
- [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/#/): Allows to create semalessly a DAO with any purpose (ConstitutionDAO in late 2021 tried to buy the auctioned Constitution - but Citadel CEO won) . Github: https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface


**Protocol DAOs**
- [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/): group of protocols running on the Ethereum blockchain that allow users to optimize their earnings on crypto assets through lending and trading services
- [Olympus](https://www.olympusdao.finance): "non pegged stablecoin" that attempts to be less volatile than traditional cryptocurrencies while not being pegged to any fiat currencies
- [tornado](https://tornado.cash): A fully decentralized protocol for private transactions on Ethereum

**Social DAOs**
- [Seedclub](https://seedclub.xyz): builds and invests in communities. has an accelerator: "A few times a year we bring the most promising community token projects together in small cohorts to work alongside some of the smartest people in the social token, creator economy and crypto spaces."
- BAYC
